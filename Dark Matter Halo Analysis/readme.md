These codes describe a comprehensive dark matter halo analysis workflow using N-body simulation data. I obtained a 50Â³ simulation box containing over 30 million particles. I used the FoF (Friends-of-Friends) algorithm from the [halotools](https://github.com/astropy/halotools) to identify halos, then used [Colossus](https://bdiemer.bitbucket.io/colossus/) to plot the halo mass function and halo density profile, and finally applied [halotools](https://github.com/astropy/halotools) and [halomod](https://github.com/halomod/halomod) to plot the two-point correlation function of dark matter halos.
